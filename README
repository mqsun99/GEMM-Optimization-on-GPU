Matrix-Multiplication Optimization on GPU with CUDA based on CUTLASS method


To build the binary:
make -C build_T4 `cat src_todo_T4/OPTIONS.txt`

To build the binary with cublas:
make -C build_T4 cublastest=1 `cat src_todo_T4/OPTIONS.txt`

To clean the output files of the make command:
make -C build_T4 clean

To Run:
./mmpy `cat src_todo_T4/OPTIONS_RUNTIME.txt` -n 256

To run Script in tools folder:
./tools/run_ncu.sh

If you get Permission denied error when executing a file:
chmod +x name_of_file
eg: chmod +x tools/*

Find GPU chipset:
lspci | grep -i --color 'vga\|3d\|2d'
