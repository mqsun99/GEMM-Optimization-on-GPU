		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Yingqi Cao

 
B: Miaoqiu Sun

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	          10         10
coding 	  	  	            30         40
writeup 	  	  	          10         10
planning (alone) 	  	  	  10         10
total (including meetings) 	60         70 	  	 


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
    Yingqi: developed 2d tiling & shared memory (used in final version), memory coalesing, parameter tuning, writeup
    Miaoqiu: developed 2d tiling & shared memory, zero padding tuning parameters, writeup
  
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
    Yes, we completed the assignment.
  
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
    Our team's strength is that we had pretty good communications and met up as much as we could to
    solve problems. We think we are good so far and don't have any weaknesses in terms of working together.
  
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
    We learned how to code in CUDA, how to measure the GPU's performance, and some methods to optimize the performance.

  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
    We worked very well so nothing needed to be changed.

  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
    This PA was really fun to implement and we learned a lot throughout the process.
